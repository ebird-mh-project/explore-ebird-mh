# explore-ebird-mh
A page displaying exploratory data from eBird for Maharashtra (Summer 2020 to Monsoon 2025). Prototype for a Species Distribution Modelling app. Will be periodically updated to add more informative details &amp; improve UI/UX. Folium/Leaflet &amp; JavaScript.  https://ebird-mh-project.github.io/explore-ebird-mh/

# TO-DO LIST as of 2026/01/30
* Readability improvements, like formatting of pop-ups, implementing map changes as views instead of iframe, 
* Add a small window showing what the codes for Behaviour and Observation Types mean 
* Add an About view, and option to alternate between Map view and About view. Explain the project, explain eBird, explain what the various stats mean.
* Add a summary for each season i.e. the WHOLE SEASON, not just grid-by-grid. Make this viewable on the right side. Summary could include a picture of the most common birds from the eBird site, along with any endangered birds observed during the season (plus, a link to learn more about the bird).
* Option to change grid colouration: plain, or based on variables (like number of observations,  IUCN status, number of migrant birds, etc)
* Turn the cursor into a little bird and make it peck when you click things, along with other aesthetic changes.
