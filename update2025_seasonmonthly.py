This will fetch data + generate monthly map & summary (generate_map.py & generate_summary.py) + generate seasonal map & summary (generate_summary_seasonal.py)
for all of 2025 + for January 2026......... then, an 'initial.yml' will be ran , in order to run THIS just once + to see if there's any issues which arise
(like with labelling, for example will it be labelled 'February' if it's executed on 1 February? It takes the 'last 30 days', too... maybe make that a
regular interval of 30 days instead of once every month? And also, it only lasts till the end of 2026. Change that in the YAML file.)
But yeah. This will be the 'test run'. Populate with the data based on the new process. Old version will be off to the side.

After this: update About page very briefly

^^^ This stuff will pretty much finish up this dashboard for the most part. Tweaks needed, but it'll be overall presentable.

then get to the SDM project, with this dashboard as the foundation for the presentation (but more DYNAMIC; have more interesting UI elements to select new variables)
